1. Initial Context
I am a beginner at coding. I will develop the project with my limited knowledge and the leverage and trust to SOTA AI Agents.I am planning to develop an elegant repository website for ai character cards with style resembling popular card hubs platforms such as Chub.ai, Janitor AI and SillyTavern. It will be simply called Cards Repo. Its purposes are to store thousands of cards as archive, have an easier overview of them and manage them efficiently. Mostly, it came from an idea of a SillyTavern user with thousands of cards, and has trouble navigating their collection which came from different character card websites and some original work. This project is for personal use as a single user.
