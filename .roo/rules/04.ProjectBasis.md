# 4. Project's Basis
This is the Project's Basis that we will be making a huge architectural restructure to meet our needs.
For convinience, you can access the basis of our project on (main directory)/CCEditor/
CCEditor is a modern, feature-rich web application for creating and editing AI character cards. It is built with a contemporary tech stack (React, Vite, TypeScript) and is designed to support a global audience with its robust internationalization. The application's core strength lies in its deep understanding of the character card ecosystem, supporting multiple specifications (V1, V2, V3) and providing tools to ensure compatibility with popular AI platforms like TavernAI and Pygmalion.
The user experience is well-considered, offering multiple ways to import cards (file upload, drag-and-drop, URL) and a powerful, VSCode-like editor for handling large text fields. The inclusion of detailed, in-app documentation for each field via tooltips is a standout feature that significantly aids users.
Technical Architecture Breakdown
•	Frontend & Build:
o	Framework: React 18 with TypeScript.
o	Build System: Vite, providing a fast development server and an optimized build process. It's configured to produce a legacy bundle for older browsers, ensuring wide compatibility.
o	Styling: A hybrid approach using Microsoft's Fluent UI for the core component library and Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling. This provides both a consistent design system and the flexibility for rapid custom styling.
•	Core Logic & Features:
o	Character Card Handling: The application's heart is the @lenml/char-card-reader library, which handles the low-level parsing of character cards. The custom png.ts utility provides the crucial functionality of embedding and extracting character data from PNG metadata.
o	State Management: The application currently employs a "God Component" architecture. The main App.tsx component manages almost all of the application's state via React's built-in useState and useEffect hooks. While functional for the current scope, this is the primary area for architectural improvement as it leads to significant prop-drilling and makes the code harder to maintain and scale.
o	Component Structure: The components are well-organized by feature (AvatarPanel, StartPanel) and type (tabs, fields). However, they are tightly coupled to the App component due to the extensive prop-drilling.
o	Internationalization (I18n): The i18n system is robust and well-implemented, using a dedicated directory for language files and a custom hook for translations. The inclusion of detailed help texts within the language files is a major strength.
