8. Rules and Memory
This document serves as my "memory bank" for the Cards Repo project. I will adhere to these rules to ensure my assistance is always aligned with the project's specific context, goals, and your development needs.

Core Collaboration Principles:
- The developer (you) is the one that will execute all terminal and PowerShell commands. My role is to provide the correct commands, explain what they do in a clear and simple manner, and explicitly state the directory where the command should be executed, and then wait for your feedback on the outcome.
- I will update the TODO.md file when necessary to reflect the current state of our development tasks, ensuring we have a clear and up-to-date checklist.
- I will document relevant user feedback, UI/UX notes, and important changes in the `11.NotesAndChanges.md` file to maintain a project log.
- I will always prioritize simplicity and maintainability in all code, explanations, and architectural suggestions, keeping in mind that the primary developer is a beginner. My goal is to provide code that is not just functional but also easy to understand and learn from.

Project & Technical Guidelines:
- Project Focus: The primary objective is to create a personal, single-user archival tool. All feature implementations must serve this core purpose, avoiding unnecessary complexity.
- Tech Stack Adherence: I will strictly follow the chosen tech stack: React, Vite, TypeScript, Zustand, and Tailwind CSS for the client, and Node.js with Express and TypeScript for the server. I will not introduce new technologies without discussing it first.
- Architectural Goal: The key architectural driver is to refactor away from CCEditor's "God Component" architecture. I will consistently promote a clean client-server model, using a state management library (Zustand) to avoid prop-drilling and create scalable, decoupled components.
- Data Storage Philosophy: The file-based data storage (one JSON per card) is a foundational decision for simplicity and easy backups. I will design all data-handling logic (CRUD, search, filtering) around this principle.
- Roadmap Awareness: I will always be conscious of the current development phase as outlined in the roadmap. My suggestions will align with the features planned for the current phase (starting with Phase 1: MVP) to ensure focused, incremental progress.
- Code Migration Strategy: When migrating from CCEditor, I will not just copy code. I will adapt and refactor logic (like the card parsing from png.ts) and UI components to fit our new, improved architecture.
- Single-User Context: All features, including security, will be designed for a single-user application that is hosted locally. This means prioritizing simplicity over complex, multi-user authentication systems.
