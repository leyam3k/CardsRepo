# 11. UI/UX Notes & Changelog

This document tracks feedback, notes, and changes related to the User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) of the Cards Repo project.

---

### Initial Setup & Core MVP (Phase 1)

**Key Changes & Learnings:**

*   **Monorepo Setup:** Established `pnpm` workspace with `packages/client` (React/Vite/TS) and `packages/server` (Node.js/Express/TS).

*   **Server API:** Implemented basic CRUD (Create, Read) for cards and image serving. Encountered and resolved `crc-32` and `multer` type declaration issues.

*   **Client UI:** Configured Tailwind CSS, integrated Zustand for state management, and created `UploadCard`, `CardGallery`, and `CardDetails` components with `react-router-dom` for navigation.

*   **Development Notes:** Identified and corrected issues with `pnpm create vite` directory nesting and `npx`/`pnpm dlx` executable paths, leading to manual file creation for Tailwind config. Updated `RulesAndMemory.md` for clearer command execution instructions.

### Phase 1 Testing & Debugging

**UI/UX Feedback & Observations:**
*   **Initial UI State:** The UI is functional but visually basic, which is expected for the MVP. The core layout for card upload, gallery, and details is in place, but lacks styling.
*   **Developer Experience (DX):** The initial server startup script (`tsc --watch & node ...`) was ambiguous and suppressed critical "server running" messages. This led to a "Failed to fetch" error on the client, creating a poor debugging experience. The process was revised to a more reliable `build` then `start` sequence.

**Technical Changes & Fixes:**
*   **PostCSS Configuration:** Corrected a PostCSS configuration issue by installing `@tailwindcss/postcss` and updating `postcss.config.js` to fix a build error that prevented the UI from rendering.
