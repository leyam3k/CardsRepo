*   **Note:** The UI for the Phase 1 MVP is intentionally basic and unstyled. The primary goal of this phase was to establish the project's technical foundation and ensure the core backend functionality for card uploading, processing, and storage was working correctly.
*   **Feedback:** User noted that the UI is "super basic and plain."
*   **Clarification:** Confirmed that this is the expected state for Phase 1 and that UI/UX enhancements are a key objective for subsequent development phases, as detailed in the project roadmap and objectives.
