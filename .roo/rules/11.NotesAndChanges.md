# 11. UI/UX Notes & Changelog

This document tracks feedback, notes, and changes related to the User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) of the Cards Repo project.

---

### Initial Setup & Core MVP (Phase 1)

**Key Changes & Learnings:**

*   **Monorepo Setup:** Established `pnpm` workspace with `packages/client` (React/Vite/TS) and `packages/server` (Node.js/Express/TS).

*   **Server API:** Implemented basic CRUD (Create, Read) for cards and image serving. Encountered and resolved `crc-32` and `multer` type declaration issues.

*   **Client UI:** Configured Tailwind CSS, integrated Zustand for state management, and created `UploadCard`, `CardGallery`, and `CardDetails` components with `react-router-dom` for navigation.

*   **Development Notes:** Identified and corrected issues with `pnpm create vite` directory nesting and `npx`/`pnpm dlx` executable paths, leading to manual file creation for Tailwind config.

---

### Phase 1 Testing & Debugging

**UI/UX Feedback & Observations:**
*   **Initial UI State:** The UI is functional but visually basic, which is expected for the MVP. The core layout for card upload, gallery, and details is in place, but lacks styling.
*   **Developer Experience (DX):** The initial server startup script (`tsc --watch & node ...`) was ambiguous and suppressed critical "server running" messages. This led to a "Failed to fetch" error on the client, creating a poor debugging experience. The process was revised to a more reliable `build` then `start` sequence.

**Technical Changes & Fixes:**
*   **PostCSS Configuration:** Corrected a PostCSS configuration issue by installing `@tailwindcss/postcss` and updating `postcss.config.js` to fix a build error that prevented the UI from rendering.

---

### Phase 2: Core Features â€“ Organization & Interaction

**Key Changes & Learnings:**

*   **Card Management (CRUD):** Implemented `PUT` and `DELETE` endpoints on the backend for card updates and deletions.
    *   **UI/UX:** Added "Edit" and "Delete" buttons to `CardDetails` page. Introduced a `FullScreenTextEditor` component for improved long-text editing (e.g., description, character details), enhancing UX for content-heavy fields.
*   **Tagging System:**
    *   **Backend:** Updated card model to include `tags` array and implemented `GET /api/tags` endpoint to fetch all unique tags.
    *   **UI/UX:** Developed a `TagInput` component for adding/editing tags on `CardDetails` (edit form) and displaying them on both `CardDetails` and `CardGallery` pages, improving card organization and visual information.
*   **Search & Filtering (V1):**
    *   **Backend:** Enhanced `GET /api/cards` to support `q` (search query for name, description, creator) and `tags` (multi-tag filtering).
    *   **UI/UX:** Added search bar and tag filter to `CardGallery` for efficient card discovery, significantly enhancing usability for large collections. Implemented debouncing for search input.
*   **User Experience (UI/UX):** Implemented a Light/Dark mode toggle with persistence via `localStorage`, providing personalization options and improving visual comfort. Configured Tailwind CSS for class-based dark mode.

---

### Client Build & Development Environment Fixes

**Technical Changes & Fixes:**
*   **TypeScript Build Errors Resolution:** Addressed and resolved multiple `TS6133: '...' is declared but its value is never read` and `TS6196: '...' is declared but never used` errors in the client-side codebase.
    *   Removed unused `React` import in `packages/client/src/App.tsx`.
    *   Removed unused `handleClose` function in `packages/client/src/components/FullScreenTextEditor.tsx`.
    *   Refactored `Card` interface usage in `packages/client/src/pages/CardGallery.tsx` by exporting it from `packages/client/src/store/cardStore.ts` and importing it as a type, and explicitly typing the `cards` array.
    *   **Developer Experience (DX) Impact:** These fixes significantly improve the client build process stability, ensuring a smoother development workflow and enabling reliable compilation for future deployments.

---

### Phase 2 Debug Session

**UI/UX Feedback & Observations:**
*   **Editable Fields:** Initial feedback indicated that 'Description', 'Character', and 'Scenario' fields were not clearly editable. This was addressed by making the "Edit" button within the `FullScreenTextEditor` component (`packages/client/src/components/FullScreenTextEditor.tsx`) always visible, improving the discoverability of the editing functionality.
*   **General UI/UX:** User feedback noted the UI as "very basic and non user friendly," and "plain." This aligns with the project roadmap's phased approach, where core functionality is prioritized in early phases, and significant UI/UX improvements are planned for later stages (Phase 3 & 4).

**Technical Changes & Fixes:**
*   **Creator Field Display:** Resolved an issue where the 'Creator' field was not displaying correctly for some cards, especially after re-upload. The problem stemmed from the server's `POST /api/cards/upload` endpoint (`packages/server/src/index.ts`) where a top-level empty `creator` field in the raw character data from the PNG was unintentionally overwriting the correct `creator` value nested within a `data` object. The fix ensures the `creator` is correctly extracted and prioritized at the top level of the saved card JSON.
*   **Tag Input Parsing:** Fixed the `TagInput` component (`packages/client/src/components/TagInput.tsx`) to correctly parse multiple tags when entered as a comma-separated string, resolving the issue where `("Sci-Fi", "Anime")` was treated as a single tag.

---

### Phase 2 Debug Session

**UI/UX Feedback & Observations:**
*   A critical build error related to PostCSS and Tailwind CSS prevented the client application's UI from rendering, impacting overall developer experience (DX) and preventing any UI interaction.

**Technical Changes & Fixes:**
*   **PostCSS Configuration Update:** Corrected the `postcss.config.js` in `packages/client` by changing `tailwindcss: {}` to `'@tailwindcss/postcss': {}`. This aligns the configuration with the updated Tailwind CSS PostCSS plugin, resolving the build failure and enabling the client UI to compile.

---

### Phase 2 Debug Session

**UI/UX Feedback & Observations:**
*   **Initial Styling Failure:** The application's UI was completely unstyled, indicating a critical failure in the CSS build pipeline.
*   **Incremental Styling:** After resolving the build failure, user feedback guided a series of incremental UI improvements. This included establishing a base layout, styling the header, improving dark mode readability, and creating a consistent design for tags.

**Technical Changes & Fixes:**
*   **Vite/PostCSS Build Resolution:** The root cause of the styling failure was a module conflict between Vite's ES Module-based environment and the PostCSS configuration. The issue was definitively resolved by replacing `postcss.config.js` with `postcss.config.cjs`, ensuring the configuration is treated as a CommonJS module and processed correctly by Vite.
*   **Iterative CSS Refinements:** Abandoned the failing Tailwind CSS approach in favor of direct CSS modifications in `App.css`. This allowed for stable, incremental improvements to the UI, including:
    *   A new, more professional header layout.
    *   A responsive grid for the card gallery.
    *   Improved text readability in dark mode.
    *   Consistent styling for tags across the application.
---
*   **Creator Field Display (Client-side):** Resolved an issue where the 'Creator' field was not immediately displayed on the `CardGallery` after card upload. The `UploadCard` component now correctly extracts the `creator` from parsed PNG data, aligning client-side state with backend processing.

### Phase 2 UI Overhaul (CCEditor Style)

**UI/UX Feedback & Observations:**
*   **Aesthetic Alignment:** User requested a UI that is "heavily based on CCEditor" to create a more professional and familiar experience.
*   **Tag Filtering UX:** Initial implementation of the tag filter was a dropdown, but user feedback indicated a preference for having all available tags visible upfront for easier selection.
*   **Upload Component Layout:** The initial upload component was deemed too spacious and a more compact, horizontal layout was requested.

**Technical Changes & Fixes:**
*   **Layout Rearchitecture:**
    *   Introduced a new `Layout.tsx` component to establish a consistent, CCEditor-style header and a two-panel structure for content.
    *   Refactored `App.tsx` to use the new layout system, simplifying its role to mainly routing.
    *   Replaced the existing CSS with a new, CCEditor-inspired dark theme in `App.css`.
*   **Component Refactoring:**
    *   **CardDetails:** Overhauled the page to use a two-panel layout, with the card avatar on the left and a tabbed interface on the right for "Basic Info" and "Details", mimicking the CCEditor workflow.
    *   **TagInput:** Completely refactored the component to align with user feedback. It now displays all available tags as toggleable buttons, providing a more intuitive and immediate filtering experience than the previous dropdown.
    *   **UploadCard:** Redesigned the component to have a more compact, horizontal layout, saving screen space on the main gallery page.
*   **Developer Experience (DX) Impact:** The UI refactoring has created a more cohesive and visually appealing application. The new layout and component structure provide a solid foundation for future feature development, ensuring a consistent user experience across the app.

### Janitor AI-Inspired UI Overhaul

**UI/UX Feedback & Observations:**
*   **Aesthetic Pivot:** User requested a major UI overhaul for the homepage to be "heavily inspired by Janitor AI," aiming for a modern, dark, and purple-themed aesthetic, while keeping the `CardDetails` page focused on its CCEditor roots.
*   **Initial Implementation:** The first pass was a direct copy, which was refined to be more of an inspiration. Hardcoded data was replaced with dynamic content, and the layout was adjusted for a better user experience.
*   **Full-Width Layout:** User requested the UI to utilize the full width of the browser, which was implemented by removing the `max-width` constraint from the main layout.

**Technical Changes & Fixes:**
*   **Hybrid Routing:** The routing in `App.tsx` was refactored to support a hybrid layout. The main gallery uses the new Janitor AI-style `Layout` (with a shared header and filter bar), while the `CardDetails` page is rendered as a standalone route to preserve its distinct, focused UI.
*   **Component-Based Architecture:**
    *   Created new, dedicated components for the `Header`, `FilterBar`, and `Card`, promoting better code organization and reusability.
    *   The `UploadCard` component was refactored into a simple button and integrated into the `Header`.
*   **Centralized State Management (Zustand):**
    *   The `cardStore` was enhanced to manage UI state, including the `searchTerm` and `selectedTags`.
    *   This allowed for a more robust and reactive filtering system, where the `CardGallery` automatically updates when the search term or selected tags change.
*   **Rendering Bug Fix:** Corrected a critical issue that caused a blank screen by refactoring the state selection in `CardGallery.tsx` to prevent an infinite re-rendering loop.

### Phase 2 Debug Session - (Character/Personality Field Resolution)

**UI/UX Feedback & Observations:**
*   **Empty Character Field:** The 'Character' field on the CardDetails page appeared empty despite existing data, leading to user confusion.

**Technical Changes & Fixes:**
*   **Server-Side Data Transformation:** Implemented a robust server-side fix in `packages/server/src/index.ts` to map the `personality` field (from raw card data) to the `character` field, ensuring consistent data delivery to the client for all cards.
*   **UI Label Update:** Renamed the field label on `CardDetails` page (`packages/client/src/pages/CardDetails.tsx`) from "Character" to "Personality" for improved clarity and alignment with source data terminology.

---

### Phase 2 Debug Session - (Editor Overhaul)

**UI/UX Feedback & Observations:**
*   The text editing fields on the `CardDetails` page were non-functional, with a broken popup. User requested a complete overhaul to integrate a CCEditor-style Monaco Editor.
*   The final UI required several iterations to perfect the interaction model: making the text fields directly editable, giving them a fixed scrollable height, and positioning a subtle full-screen icon button outside the field, aligned with the label.

**Technical Changes & Fixes:**
*   **Build & Dependency Hell:** A significant portion of the session was spent debugging a series of cascading build failures. This involved installing `@monaco-editor/react` and `vite-plugin-monaco-editor`, then fixing ES Module/CommonJS conflicts by migrating from `vite.config.ts` to `vite.config.cjs`, and finally updating `tsconfig.node.json` to correctly process the new `.cjs` and `.js` config files.
*   **Styling & Layout:**
    *   The Monaco Editor initially failed to render due to global CSS in `App.css` overriding Tailwind utility classes. This was resolved by using inline styles for the modal's layout, which proved to be the most reliable solution.
    *   The `FullScreenTextEditor` component was refactored multiple times to meet UX requirements, finally separating the `textarea` for in-field editing from the icon button that triggers the full-screen Monaco Editor.
    *   The `CardDetails` page layout was tweaked to fix a horizontal overflow issue and improve component spacing.

---

### Phase 2 Debug Session - (Tagging UX Refinements)

**UI/UX Feedback & Observations:**
*   **Tag Filtering UX:** The homepage tag filter was improved by "pinning" selected tags to the top of the list, preventing them from disappearing while searching. This provides a more stable and intuitive filtering experience.
*   **Tag Creation UX:** The process for creating new tags on the `CardDetails` page was fixed to provide immediate visual feedback, showing the new tag in the list as soon as it's typed.

**Technical Changes & Fixes:**
*   **Tag Parsing & Display:** Fixed a bug that prevented creating multiple tags from a comma-separated string. Also removed the three-tag limit on the `CardGallery` view, ensuring all tags are now visible.
*   **Component Logic:** Refined the logic in both the `FilterBar.tsx` and `TagInput.tsx` components to handle the improved filtering and creation workflows, separating concerns between the homepage and the details page.

---

### Phase 2 Debug Session - (Server-Side Deletion)

**UI/UX Feedback & Observations:**
*   **Developer Experience (DX):** Deleting a card caused unnecessary `ENOENT` error logs on the server. While this didn't crash the server or affect the end-user UI, it cluttered the development logs and pointed to a lack of robustness in the backend.

**Technical Changes & Fixes:**
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** Through systematic logging, we determined the error did not originate from the `DELETE` endpoint itself, but from a subsequent client-side request to the `GET /api/images/:imageFilename` endpoint for the just-deleted image.
*   **Endpoint Hardening:** The `GET /api/images/:imageFilename` endpoint in `packages/server/src/index.ts` was updated to first check for the file's existence. It now correctly returns a `404 Not Found` status if the image is missing, preventing the server-side error and improving overall API resilience.

---

### Phase 1 Rework Resolutions

**Key Changes & Learnings:**

*   **Architectural Overhaul:** The entire application was refactored to use a **folder-per-card** data model, a foundational change to support future versioning and file management.
*   **Server-Side:**
    *   The backend now creates a dedicated folder for each card (`/data/cards/<card-id>`) containing its `card.json` and `avatar.png`.
    *   API endpoints (`GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`) were updated to work with the new directory structure.
    *   **UX:** The API now returns a complete `imageUrl`, simplifying client-side logic.
*   **Client-Side:**
    *   The Zustand store (`cardStore.ts`) and all relevant components (`UploadCard.tsx`, `Card.tsx`, `CardDetails.tsx`) were updated to use the new `imageUrl` property and align with the simplified API responses.
    *   **DX:** Client-side PNG parsing on upload was removed, as the server now provides the complete card object, making the code cleaner and more efficient.

---

### Phase 2 Rework

**Key Changes & Learnings:**

*   **Full CCEditor-Style Editing:**
    *   **UI/UX:** The `CardDetails` page has been completely redesigned with a two-column layout, providing a comprehensive and intuitive CCEditor-like interface. All major character fields are now editable through a tabbed view.
    *   **Backend:** Implemented `Duplicate Card` functionality on the backend.
*   **Advanced Filtering & Sorting:**
    *   **UI/UX:** The main gallery's filter bar now includes controls for sorting by name/date and filtering by a date range.
    *   **Backend:** The API now supports the new sorting and date-range queries.
*   **Data & Versioning:**
    *   **Backend:** The server now automatically adds and updates `importDate` and `lastModified` timestamps for every card, providing crucial versioning information.
    *   **UI/UX:** These new dates are displayed clearly on the `CardDetails` page.

---

### Phase 2 Rework Testing

**Key Changes & Learnings:**

*   **UI/UX:** Added a "Copy to Clipboard" button with an icon to all long-text editor fields, improving usability for content extraction.
*   **State Management:** Resolved a bug where the `FilterBar` would not update with new tags after a card upload. Centralized tag management in the Zustand store to ensure the UI remains reactive and consistent across components.
*   **Backend Filtering:** Fixed a critical off-by-one-day error in the date range filter by correcting the server-side date parsing logic to properly handle local timezones, ensuring accurate filtering results.

---

### Phase 2 Rework Refinements

**Key Changes & Learnings:**

*   **Duplicate Card UX:** Reworked the "Duplicate Card" function to be non-destructive.
    *   **Backend:** Instead of appending `(Copy)` to the card's name, the server now adds an `isCopy: true` flag to the new card's JSON file.
    *   **UI/UX:** The UI now displays a `(Copy)` label next to the card name if the `isCopy` flag is present. This preserves data integrity while providing a clear visual cue.
*   **Tag Management System:** Implemented a persistent, global tag management system to prevent tags from being deleted when unassigned from a card.
    *   **Backend:** Created a central `tags.json` file to store all tags ever created. API endpoints now use this file as the single source of truth for creating, updating, and fetching tags.
    *   **UI/UX:** The `CardDetails` page now refreshes the global tag list after saving a card, ensuring the UI is always in sync with the persistent backend data. This provides a more predictable and reliable user experience for tag management.

---

### Phase 2 Refinements Part 2

**Key Changes & Learnings:**

*   **Filter UX:** Enhanced the gallery filter bar for a more intuitive user experience.
    *   **UI/UX:** Added "Clear" buttons to the main search, tag search, and date range filters for quick resets.
    *   **UI/UX:** The tag search and tag list now appear on the same line for a more compact layout.
*   **Advanced Sorting & Filtering:** Implemented more granular control over sorting and date filtering.
    *   **Backend & UI:** Introduced a dropdown to let users select the date field for filtering (e.g., `Import Date`, `Last Modified Date`). The backend now dynamically applies filters to the selected field.
    *   **Backend & UI:** Replaced the single sort dropdown with two separate controls for "Sort By" (Name, Date, etc.) and "Sort Direction" (Ascending/Descending), providing more explicit control.
    *   **DX:** Added commented-out placeholders for future filter/sort options to guide future development.

---

### Phase 2 Rework Reversions

**Key Changes & Learnings:**

*   **Strategic Deferment:** Postponed the "Spec Version" selector UI from Phase 2.5 to Phase 3 to keep the current development phase focused on core data editing. All planning documents (`03`, `06`, `07`, `10`) were updated to reflect this.
*   **UI/UX:** Commented out the "Spec Version" display on the `CardDetails` page to align the UI with the revised plan.
*   **Data Integrity:**
    *   **Client:** Removed the `spec` field from the client-side `Card` data model (`cardStore.ts`).
    *   **Server:** Hardened the card upload endpoint (`index.ts`) to explicitly save only the data fields required by the application, preventing unused data from being stored in `card.json`. This change maintains full backward compatibility for V1, V2, and V3 cards.

---

### Phase 2.5 Rework Resolutions

**Key Changes & Learnings:**

*   **V2/V3 Spec-Compliance:**
    *   **Data Model:** Updated the core `Card` interface and server-side logic to be fully compliant with the V2/V3 specifications. This included adding fields like `nickname`, `character_version`, `alternate_greetings`, and `extensions`.
    *   **Backend:** Enhanced the card upload endpoint to correctly parse and flatten data from V2/V3 cards.
*   **CCEditor-Style UI Enhancements:**
    *   **UI/UX:** The `CardDetails` page was significantly overhauled to include new tabs and fields inspired by CCEditor.
    *   **New Component (`TextArrayEditor`):** A reusable component for managing string arrays was created to handle `Alternate Greetings` and `Group Only Greetings`.
    *   **New Component (`JsonViewer`):** A reusable component was created to display raw JSON data in the new "Advanced" tab, complete with "Copy" and "Popout" functionality for better usability.
*   **UI Refinements:**
    *   **UI/UX:** The entire `CardDetails` edit form was refactored for a more compact and space-efficient layout, improving the overall user experience.
*   **Search Enhancement:**
    *   **Backend:** Extended the fuzzy search to include all new V2/V3 detail fields, significantly improving card discoverability.

---

### Phase 2.5 Bug Fixes & Refinements

**Technical Changes & Fixes:**
*   Resolved a bug in the greetings editor that only allowed single-character inputs by correcting the component's state management logic.
*   The URL/Link field was converted to a multi-line textarea to accommodate longer URLs and improve usability.
---

### Phase 2.5 Additions (JSON Import)

**Key Changes & Learnings:**

*   **Flexible Card Imports:** Implemented support for uploading character cards from `.json` files, in addition to `.png` files. This improves the application's flexibility for archiving cards from various sources.
*   **Default Avatar System:**
    *   **Backend:** When a card is uploaded via a `.json` file (which has no embedded image), the server now automatically assigns a default avatar located at `packages/server/public/default.png`.
    *   **DX:** Resolved a bug where an incorrect server path prevented the default avatar from being copied, which caused `404` errors on the client. Correcting the path fixed the issue.
*   **UI/UX:** The file upload component now accepts both `.png` and `.json` files, providing a seamless experience for the user.

---

### Phase 2.5 JSON Export Fix

**Technical Changes & Fixes:**
*   **Spec-Compliant JSON Export:** Resolved a critical bug where downloading a card as a `.json` file would export the application's internal, flat data structure instead of the required V3 spec-compliant format.
    *   **Data Transformation:** Implemented a new `convertToSpecV3` function on the client-side (`packages/client/src/pages/CardDetails.tsx`) that transforms the internal card object into a nested structure with the correct `spec`, `data`, and `metadata` fields before serialization.
    *   **UI/UX Impact:** This fix ensures that exported JSON files are now fully compatible with external tools like SillyTavern, resolving the greeting recognition issue and improving data interoperability.
---

### Phase 3 Resolutions Part 1

**Key Changes & Learnings:**

*   **Character Book Feature:**
    *   **Backend:** Updated server to save and search within `character_book` data.
    *   **UI/UX:** Added a new "Character Book" tab to the `CardDetails` page with a full-featured accordion editor for managing lorebook entries (add, delete, edit keywords/content).
*   **Templating Tool:**
    *   **UI/UX:** Added a new "Tool" tab with a basic templating engine. Users can write a template with `{{field_name}}` placeholders and generate text based on the current card's data.
*   **Spec-Compliant Export:**
    *   **UI/UX:** Added a dropdown to select the export specification (`V2`, `V3`, `Max`).
    *   **Data:** The JSON export function now dynamically formats the output to match the selected specification, ensuring compatibility with other tools.
*   **File Management:**
    *   **Backend:** Implemented new API endpoints to upload, serve, and delete associated card files (`.html`, `.json`).
    *   **UI/UX:** Added a new "Files" tab providing a UI to manage these associated files for each card.
---

### Phase 3 Part 1 Additions (Character Book Overhaul)

**Key Changes & Learnings:**

*   **Spec-Compliant Lorebook Editor:**
    *   **UI/UX:** Overhauled the `CharacterBookEditor` to mirror CCEditor's layout, adding all missing spec-compliant fields (`Secondary Keys`, `Comment`, `Insertion Order`, `Position`, `Constant`, `Selective`) and an `Extensions` JSON viewer.
    *   **UI/UX:** The editor's layout was made significantly more compact to improve usability when managing many entries.
*   **Context-Aware Keywords:**
    *   **UX:** Keyword suggestions for lorebook entries are now sourced from other keywords within the book itself, rather than global card tags, providing more relevant suggestions.
*   **Component Refactoring:**
    *   **DX:** The `TagInput` component was made more flexible by allowing an optional `availableTags` prop, enabling its use with local data sources.
