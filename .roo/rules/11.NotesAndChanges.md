# 11. UI/UX Notes & Changelog

This document tracks feedback, notes, and changes related to the User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) of the Cards Repo project.

---

### Initial Setup & Core MVP (Phase 1)

**Key Changes & Learnings:**

*   **Monorepo Setup:** Established `pnpm` workspace with `packages/client` (React/Vite/TS) and `packages/server` (Node.js/Express/TS).

*   **Server API:** Implemented basic CRUD (Create, Read) for cards and image serving. Encountered and resolved `crc-32` and `multer` type declaration issues.

*   **Client UI:** Configured Tailwind CSS, integrated Zustand for state management, and created `UploadCard`, `CardGallery`, and `CardDetails` components with `react-router-dom` for navigation.

*   **Development Notes:** Identified and corrected issues with `pnpm create vite` directory nesting and `npx`/`pnpm dlx` executable paths, leading to manual file creation for Tailwind config. Updated `RulesAndMemory.md` for clearer command execution instructions.

---

### Phase 1 Testing & Debugging

**UI/UX Feedback & Observations:**
*   **Initial UI State:** The UI is functional but visually basic, which is expected for the MVP. The core layout for card upload, gallery, and details is in place, but lacks styling.
*   **Developer Experience (DX):** The initial server startup script (`tsc --watch & node ...`) was ambiguous and suppressed critical "server running" messages. This led to a "Failed to fetch" error on the client, creating a poor debugging experience. The process was revised to a more reliable `build` then `start` sequence.

**Technical Changes & Fixes:**
*   **PostCSS Configuration:** Corrected a PostCSS configuration issue by installing `@tailwindcss/postcss` and updating `postcss.config.js` to fix a build error that prevented the UI from rendering.

---

### Phase 2: Core Features â€“ Organization & Interaction

**Key Changes & Learnings:**

*   **Card Management (CRUD):** Implemented `PUT` and `DELETE` endpoints on the backend for card updates and deletions.
    *   **UI/UX:** Added "Edit" and "Delete" buttons to `CardDetails` page. Introduced a `FullScreenTextEditor` component for improved long-text editing (e.g., description, character details), enhancing UX for content-heavy fields.
*   **Tagging System:**
    *   **Backend:** Updated card model to include `tags` array and implemented `GET /api/tags` endpoint to fetch all unique tags.
    *   **UI/UX:** Developed a `TagInput` component for adding/editing tags on `CardDetails` (edit form) and displaying them on both `CardDetails` and `CardGallery` pages, improving card organization and visual information.
*   **Search & Filtering (V1):**
    *   **Backend:** Enhanced `GET /api/cards` to support `q` (search query for name, description, creator) and `tags` (multi-tag filtering).
    *   **UI/UX:** Added search bar and tag filter to `CardGallery` for efficient card discovery, significantly enhancing usability for large collections. Implemented debouncing for search input.
*   **User Experience (UI/UX):** Implemented a Light/Dark mode toggle with persistence via `localStorage`, providing personalization options and improving visual comfort. Configured Tailwind CSS for class-based dark mode.

### Client Build & Development Environment Fixes

**Technical Changes & Fixes:**
*   **TypeScript Build Errors Resolution:** Addressed and resolved multiple `TS6133: '...' is declared but its value is never read` and `TS6196: '...' is declared but never used` errors in the client-side codebase.
    *   Removed unused `React` import in `packages/client/src/App.tsx`.
    *   Removed unused `handleClose` function in `packages/client/src/components/FullScreenTextEditor.tsx`.
    *   Refactored `Card` interface usage in `packages/client/src/pages/CardGallery.tsx` by exporting it from `packages/client/src/store/cardStore.ts` and importing it as a type, and explicitly typing the `cards` array.
    *   **Developer Experience (DX) Impact:** These fixes significantly improve the client build process stability, ensuring a smoother development workflow and enabling reliable compilation for future deployments.

### Phase 2 Debug Session

**UI/UX Feedback & Observations:**
*   **Editable Fields:** Initial feedback indicated that 'Description', 'Character', and 'Scenario' fields were not clearly editable. This was addressed by making the "Edit" button within the `FullScreenTextEditor` component (`packages/client/src/components/FullScreenTextEditor.tsx`) always visible, improving the discoverability of the editing functionality.
*   **General UI/UX:** User feedback noted the UI as "very basic and non user friendly," and "plain." This aligns with the project roadmap's phased approach, where core functionality is prioritized in early phases, and significant UI/UX improvements are planned for later stages (Phase 3 & 4).

**Technical Changes & Fixes:**
*   **Creator Field Display:** Resolved an issue where the 'Creator' field was not displaying correctly for some cards, especially after re-upload. The problem stemmed from the server's `POST /api/cards/upload` endpoint (`packages/server/src/index.ts`) where a top-level empty `creator` field in the raw character data from the PNG was unintentionally overwriting the correct `creator` value nested within a `data` object. The fix ensures the `creator` is correctly extracted and prioritized at the top level of the saved card JSON.
*   **Tag Input Parsing:** Fixed the `TagInput` component (`packages/client/src/components/TagInput.tsx`) to correctly parse multiple tags when entered as a comma-separated string, resolving the issue where `("Sci-Fi", "Anime")` was treated as a single tag.

---

### Phase 2 Debug Session

**UI/UX Feedback & Observations:**
*   A critical build error related to PostCSS and Tailwind CSS prevented the client application's UI from rendering, impacting overall developer experience (DX) and preventing any UI interaction.

**Technical Changes & Fixes:**
*   **PostCSS Configuration Update:** Corrected the `postcss.config.js` in `packages/client` by changing `tailwindcss: {}` to `'@tailwindcss/postcss': {}`. This aligns the configuration with the updated Tailwind CSS PostCSS plugin, resolving the build failure and enabling the client UI to compile.

---

### Phase 2 Debug Session

**UI/UX Feedback & Observations:**
*   **Initial Styling Failure:** The application's UI was completely unstyled, indicating a critical failure in the CSS build pipeline.
*   **Incremental Styling:** After resolving the build failure, user feedback guided a series of incremental UI improvements. This included establishing a base layout, styling the header, improving dark mode readability, and creating a consistent design for tags.

**Technical Changes & Fixes:**
*   **Vite/PostCSS Build Resolution:** The root cause of the styling failure was a module conflict between Vite's ES Module-based environment and the PostCSS configuration. The issue was definitively resolved by replacing `postcss.config.js` with `postcss.config.cjs`, ensuring the configuration is treated as a CommonJS module and processed correctly by Vite.
*   **Iterative CSS Refinements:** Abandoned the failing Tailwind CSS approach in favor of direct CSS modifications in `App.css`. This allowed for stable, incremental improvements to the UI, including:
    *   A new, more professional header layout.
    *   A responsive grid for the card gallery.
    *   Improved text readability in dark mode.
    *   Consistent styling for tags across the application.
---
*   **Creator Field Display (Client-side):** Resolved an issue where the 'Creator' field was not immediately displayed on the `CardGallery` after card upload. The `UploadCard` component now correctly extracts the `creator` from parsed PNG data, aligning client-side state with backend processing.

### Phase 2 UI Overhaul (CCEditor Style)

**UI/UX Feedback & Observations:**
*   **Aesthetic Alignment:** User requested a UI that is "heavily based on CCEditor" to create a more professional and familiar experience.
*   **Tag Filtering UX:** Initial implementation of the tag filter was a dropdown, but user feedback indicated a preference for having all available tags visible upfront for easier selection.
*   **Upload Component Layout:** The initial upload component was deemed too spacious and a more compact, horizontal layout was requested.

**Technical Changes & Fixes:**
*   **Layout Rearchitecture:**
    *   Introduced a new `Layout.tsx` component to establish a consistent, CCEditor-style header and a two-panel structure for content.
    *   Refactored `App.tsx` to use the new layout system, simplifying its role to mainly routing.
    *   Replaced the existing CSS with a new, CCEditor-inspired dark theme in `App.css`.
*   **Component Refactoring:**
    *   **CardDetails:** Overhauled the page to use a two-panel layout, with the card avatar on the left and a tabbed interface on the right for "Basic Info" and "Details", mimicking the CCEditor workflow.
    *   **TagInput:** Completely refactored the component to align with user feedback. It now displays all available tags as toggleable buttons, providing a more intuitive and immediate filtering experience than the previous dropdown.
    *   **UploadCard:** Redesigned the component to have a more compact, horizontal layout, saving screen space on the main gallery page.
*   **Developer Experience (DX) Impact:** The UI refactoring has created a more cohesive and visually appealing application. The new layout and component structure provide a solid foundation for future feature development, ensuring a consistent user experience across the app.

### Janitor AI-Inspired UI Overhaul

**UI/UX Feedback & Observations:**
*   **Aesthetic Pivot:** User requested a major UI overhaul for the homepage to be "heavily inspired by Janitor AI," aiming for a modern, dark, and purple-themed aesthetic, while keeping the `CardDetails` page focused on its CCEditor roots.
*   **Initial Implementation:** The first pass was a direct copy, which was refined to be more of an inspiration. Hardcoded data was replaced with dynamic content, and the layout was adjusted for a better user experience.
*   **Full-Width Layout:** User requested the UI to utilize the full width of the browser, which was implemented by removing the `max-width` constraint from the main layout.

**Technical Changes & Fixes:**
*   **Hybrid Routing:** The routing in `App.tsx` was refactored to support a hybrid layout. The main gallery uses the new Janitor AI-style `Layout` (with a shared header and filter bar), while the `CardDetails` page is rendered as a standalone route to preserve its distinct, focused UI.
*   **Component-Based Architecture:**
    *   Created new, dedicated components for the `Header`, `FilterBar`, and `Card`, promoting better code organization and reusability.
    *   The `UploadCard` component was refactored into a simple button and integrated into the `Header`.
*   **Centralized State Management (Zustand):**
    *   The `cardStore` was enhanced to manage UI state, including the `searchTerm` and `selectedTags`.
    *   This allowed for a more robust and reactive filtering system, where the `CardGallery` automatically updates when the search term or selected tags change.
*   **Rendering Bug Fix:** Corrected a critical issue that caused a blank screen by refactoring the state selection in `CardGallery.tsx` to prevent an infinite re-rendering loop.

### Phase 2 Debug Session - (Character/Personality Field Resolution)

**UI/UX Feedback & Observations:**
*   **Empty Character Field:** The 'Character' field on the CardDetails page appeared empty despite existing data, leading to user confusion.

**Technical Changes & Fixes:**
*   **Server-Side Data Transformation:** Implemented a robust server-side fix in `packages/server/src/index.ts` to map the `personality` field (from raw card data) to the `character` field, ensuring consistent data delivery to the client for all cards.
*   **UI Label Update:** Renamed the field label on `CardDetails` page (`packages/client/src/pages/CardDetails.tsx`) from "Character" to "Personality" for improved clarity and alignment with source data terminology.

---

### Phase 2 Debug Session - (Editor Overhaul)

**UI/UX Feedback & Observations:**
*   The text editing fields on the `CardDetails` page were non-functional, with a broken popup. User requested a complete overhaul to integrate a CCEditor-style Monaco Editor.
*   The final UI required several iterations to perfect the interaction model: making the text fields directly editable, giving them a fixed scrollable height, and positioning a subtle full-screen icon button outside the field, aligned with the label.

**Technical Changes & Fixes:**
*   **Build & Dependency Hell:** A significant portion of the session was spent debugging a series of cascading build failures. This involved installing `@monaco-editor/react` and `vite-plugin-monaco-editor`, then fixing ES Module/CommonJS conflicts by migrating from `vite.config.ts` to `vite.config.cjs`, and finally updating `tsconfig.node.json` to correctly process the new `.cjs` and `.js` config files.
*   **Styling & Layout:**
    *   The Monaco Editor initially failed to render due to global CSS in `App.css` overriding Tailwind utility classes. This was resolved by using inline styles for the modal's layout, which proved to be the most reliable solution.
    *   The `FullScreenTextEditor` component was refactored multiple times to meet UX requirements, finally separating the `textarea` for in-field editing from the icon button that triggers the full-screen Monaco Editor.
    *   The `CardDetails` page layout was tweaked to fix a horizontal overflow issue and improve component spacing.

### Phase 2 Debug Session - (Tagging UX Refinements)

**UI/UX Feedback & Observations:**
*   **Tag Filtering UX:** The homepage tag filter was improved by "pinning" selected tags to the top of the list, preventing them from disappearing while searching. This provides a more stable and intuitive filtering experience.
*   **Tag Creation UX:** The process for creating new tags on the `CardDetails` page was fixed to provide immediate visual feedback, showing the new tag in the list as soon as it's typed.

**Technical Changes & Fixes:**
*   **Tag Parsing & Display:** Fixed a bug that prevented creating multiple tags from a comma-separated string. Also removed the three-tag limit on the `CardGallery` view, ensuring all tags are now visible.
*   **Component Logic:** Refined the logic in both the `FilterBar.tsx` and `TagInput.tsx` components to handle the improved filtering and creation workflows, separating concerns between the homepage and the details page.
