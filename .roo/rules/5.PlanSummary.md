5. Plan Summary
The development will be based on the existing CCEditor project, creating a new, standalone application in a separate folder. The core strategy is to build a full-stack application by adding a lightweight backend to handle data persistence and business logic, which was not present in the client-only CCEditor.

Project Scaffolding: A new project directory named CardsRepo will be initiated. It will contain a client folder for the React frontend and a server folder for the Node.js backend.

Code Migration & Refactoring: We will strategically migrate and adapt key functionalities from CCEditor. The card data parsing logic (src/tools/png.ts:1) and reusable UI components will be moved to the new project. The frontend architecture will be refactored away from the single "God Component" (src/components/App.tsx:1) to a more scalable model using a dedicated state management library.

Backend Development: A new, simple backend will be created to manage the core archival functions. This server will handle file system interactions, provide an API for the frontend to manage cards (create, read, update, delete), and implement the search, filtering, and tagging logic.

Data Storage: To prioritize simplicity and data integrity, the initial approach will be a file-based system. Each character card, along with its metadata, will be stored as an individual JSON file on the server. This makes backups (copying a folder) and data recovery trivial.

Proposed Tech Stack  
This stack is chosen to be modern, maintainable, and beginner-friendly, leveraging the strengths of the original CCEditor project while building a robust foundation for the new requirements.

Frontend (Client):

Framework: React with TypeScript for a strong, typed codebase.  
Build Tool: Vite for a fast and modern development experience.  
State Management: Zustand. It is a lightweight, simple, and unopinionated state management solution that avoids the complexity of Redux and the prop-drilling issues seen in App.tsx.  
Styling: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, allowing for rapid and flexible UI development. We will re-evaluate the use of Fluent UI to ensure the aesthetic goals are met without unnecessary complexity.  
Routing: React Router for managing navigation within the single-page application.

Backend (Server):

Runtime: Node.js  
Framework: Express.js with TypeScript. It's a minimal and flexible framework, perfect for building the required API endpoints for card management without significant overhead.  
Database:

Primary: File-based storage (JSON files). Each card is a .json file, making the data human-readable, easily portable, and simple to back up.  
Future Option: SQLite. If performance becomes a concern with a very large number of cards, the backend can be adapted to use a lightweight, file-based SQL database like SQLite.  
Core Libraries:

Card Parsing: We will continue to use the @lenml/char-card-reader library and the custom PNG metadata logic found in src/tools/png.ts from the original project.
