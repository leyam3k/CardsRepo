# 5. Plan Summary
The development will be based on the existing CCEditor project, creating a new, standalone application in a separate folder. The core strategy is to build a full-stack application by adding a lightweight backend to handle data persistence and business logic, which was not present in the client-only CCEditor.

Project Scaffolding: A new project directory named CardsRepo will be initiated. It will contain a client folder for the React frontend and a server folder for the Node.js backend.

Code Migration & Refactoring: We will strategically migrate and adapt key functionalities from CCEditor. The core card data parsing logic (from src/tools/png.ts) will be moved to the new project. The frontend architecture will be refactored away from the single "God Component" (src/components/App.tsx:1) to a more scalable model, with UI components being rebuilt with inspiration from CCEditor's functionality using a dedicated state management library.

Backend Development: A new, simple backend will be created to manage the core archival functions. This server will handle file system interactions, provide an API for the frontend to manage cards (create, read, update, delete), and implement the search, filtering, and tagging logic.

Data Storage: To prioritize simplicity, data integrity, and future extensibility, the project will use a **folder-per-card** system. Each card will be stored in its own dedicated directory on the server, containing its `card.json` data, `avatar.png` image, and sub-folders for future assets like image galleries and version history. This makes backups (copying a folder) and data recovery trivial while providing a scalable structure.

Proposed Tech Stack  
This stack is chosen to be modern, maintainable, and beginner-friendly, leveraging the strengths of the original CCEditor project while building a robust foundation for the new requirements.

Frontend (Client):

Framework: React with TypeScript for a strong, typed codebase.  
Build Tool: Vite for a fast and modern development experience.  
State Management: Zustand. It is a lightweight, simple, and unopinionated state management solution that avoids the complexity of Redux and the prop-drilling issues seen in App.tsx.  
Styling: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, supplemented with custom CSS files for theme-level and component-specific styles. This provides both rapid development and fine-grained control over the application's appearance.
Routing: React Router for managing navigation within the single-page application.

Backend (Server):

Runtime: Node.js  
Framework: Express.js with TypeScript. It's a minimal and flexible framework, perfect for building the required API endpoints for card management without significant overhead.  
Database:

Primary: **Folder-per-card file-based storage.** Each card's data is a `card.json` file within its own directory, making the data human-readable, easily portable, and simple to back up.
Future Option: SQLite. If performance becomes a concern with a very large number of cards, the backend can be adapted to use a lightweight, file-based SQL database like SQLite.  
Core Libraries:

Card Parsing: We will adapt and use the custom PNG metadata parsing logic found in the original CCEditor project's `src/tools/png.ts` file.
