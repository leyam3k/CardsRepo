# 6. Project Roadmap
This roadmap outlines the development in four distinct phases, prioritizing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) first and then incrementally adding layers of functionality.
Phase 1: Foundation & MVP – The Core Archive
Goal: To establish the project's technical foundation and deliver the essential functionality for importing and viewing cards. This phase focuses on getting a usable, albeit simple, version of the application running.
Key Features:
•	Project Setup: Create the new monorepo structure with separate client (React) and server (Express) packages.
•	Backend API (V1): Develop the initial server with basic API endpoints to:
o	Read all cards for the main gallery view.
o	Handle single card uploads (from .png files).
o	Serve individual card data.
•	Frontend UI:
o	Migrate and adapt the core card parsing logic from CCEditor.
o	Build the main gallery page to display all imported cards.
o	Create a simple, read-only "Card Details" page.
•	Data Storage: Implement the file-based storage system where each card is a separate JSON file on the server.
Confirmation Before Proceeding:
•	Manual Test: Successfully upload a character card.
•	Verification: Confirm the card's data is parsed correctly and saved as a new JSON file in the designated server directory. The card's image should be visible in the gallery.
Phase 2: Core Features – Organization & Interaction
Goal: To build upon the MVP by adding the fundamental tools for organizing and managing the card collection.
Key Features:
•	Card Management:
o	Implement the "Edit Card" functionality.
o	Implement the "Delete Card" functionality (initially a direct delete, with a recycle bin planned for later).
•	Basic Organization:
o	Develop the tagging system: create new tags and assign/remove them from cards.
•	Search & Filter (V1):
o	Implement a basic text search across card names and descriptions.
o	Implement filtering by one or more tags.
•	UX: Add a basic light/dark mode toggle.
Confirmation Before Proceeding:
•	Manual Test: Edit a card and verify the changes persist.
•	Verification: Create several tags, apply them to multiple cards, and confirm the tag-based filter returns the correct results. A deleted card should be removed from the UI and its corresponding file deleted from the server.
Phase 3: Advanced Management – Power & Efficiency
Goal: To introduce more powerful, "power-user" features for managing a large and complex collection efficiently.
Key Features:
•	Advanced Filtering: Add filters for attributes like "has lorebook," "has gallery," star rating, etc.
•	Bulk Actions: Implement the ability to select multiple cards and perform actions like "add tag to selected" or "delete selected."
•	Merge Cards: Create the UI and backend logic to merge two duplicate cards into one.
•	Favorites System: Add the ability to mark cards as "favorites" for quick access.
•	Tag Management: A dedicated page to view, edit, and merge tags.
Confirmation Before Proceeding:
•	Manual Test: Use the bulk-tagging feature on a set of cards and verify the result.
•	Verification: Successfully merge two cards, ensuring the final card contains the correctly selected data and the old cards are archived/deleted as intended. Filters for favorites and other attributes should work as expected.
Phase 4: Personalization, Data Integrity & Deployment
Goal: To finalize the application by adding personalization features, ensuring data longevity, and preparing it for easy local deployment.
Key Features:
•	Data Integrity:
o	Implement a simple, one-click "Backup" and "Restore" feature.
o	Introduce granular version control where edits create a new version of the card's JSON file instead of overwriting it.
•	Personalization:
o	Add a "Custom User Notes" section to each card.
•	Security & Access:
o	Implement a simple password protection system for the application.
o	Ensure the application can be easily run locally and provide documentation for accessing it across a local network.
Confirmation Before Proceeding:
•	Manual Test: Create a full backup of the card library. Delete a card, then use the restore function.
•	Verification: The deleted card should reappear, confirming the backup/restore cycle works. Editing a card should create a timestamped copy of the previous version in an archive folder. The password system should successfully lock access.
