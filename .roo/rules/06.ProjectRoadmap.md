# 6. Project Roadmap
This roadmap outlines the development in four distinct phases, prioritizing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) first and then incrementally adding layers of functionality.
Phase 1: Foundation & MVP – The Core Archive
Goal: To establish the project's technical foundation and deliver the essential functionality for importing and viewing cards. This phase focuses on getting a usable, albeit simple, version of the application running.
Key Features:
•	Project Setup: Create the new monorepo structure with separate client (React) and server (Express) packages.
•	Backend API (V1): Develop the initial server with basic API endpoints to:
o	Read all cards for the main gallery view.
o	Handle single card uploads (from .png files).
o	Serve individual card data.
•	Frontend UI:
o	Migrate and adapt the core card parsing logic from CCEditor.
o	Build the main gallery page to display all imported cards.
o	Create a simple, read-only "Card Details" page.
•	**New: Data Storage (Revised Architecture):** Implement a **folder-per-card** storage system. Each card upload will create a dedicated directory containing its `card.json` data and `avatar.png` image. This is a foundational change to support future versioning and gallery features.
•	**New Feature: Foundational Data Support:** The backend will be prepared to store additional files per card, specifically for `card.html`, `creator_notes.html`, and `chat_logs.json`, even if the UI to manage them comes in a later phase.
Confirmation Before Proceeding:
•	Manual Test: Successfully upload a character card.
•	Verification: Confirm the card's data is parsed correctly and a new folder is created for it on the server, containing the correct JSON data and image file. The card's image should be visible in the gallery.

Phase 2: Core Features – Organization & Interaction
Goal: To build upon the MVP by adding the fundamental tools for organizing and managing the card collection, with a focus on creating a complete CCEditor-style editing experience.
Key Features:
•	**New: Card Management (Major Enhancement):**
o	**Frontend:** Overhaul the `CardDetails` page to match the CCEditor two-column layout, including all core fields from the "Basic Info" and "Details" tabs. This includes implementing fields for Name, Nickname, Creator, Description, Personality, Scenario, First Message, Alternate Greetings, and more. **New Feature:** Also add fields for `Language` and a `URL/Link` field.
o	**Frontend:** The left column will display the card's avatar, initial filename, image dimensions, and detected Spec Version, along with action buttons for `Edit`, `Download PNG`, and `Download JSON`.
o	**Backend:** Expand the `PUT /api/cards/:id` endpoint to handle updates for all the newly implemented fields.
o	Implement the "Delete Card" functionality (direct delete with enhanced confirmation).
o	**New Feature:** Implement `Duplicate Card` functionality.
o	**New Feature:** Add a `Copy Field to Clipboard` button for essential text fields.
•	Basic Organization:
o	Develop the tagging system: create new tags and assign/remove them from cards.
•	Search & Filter (V1):
o	**New Feature: Implement Fuzzy Search** across key card attributes (name, creator, description) to provide typo-tolerant results.
o	Implement filtering by one or more tags.
o	**New Feature:** Implement filtering by a `Date Range` (creation, modification).
o	**New Feature:** Implement `Sort Order` (ascending/descending) for search results.
•	**New: Date Tracking:**
o	The backend will automatically add `importDate` and `lastModified` timestamps to the card's JSON data. These will be displayed in the UI.
Confirmation Before Proceeding:
•	Manual Test: Edit a card using the new CCEditor-style interface and verify all changes persist.
•	Verification: Create several tags, apply them to multiple cards, and confirm the tag-based filter returns the correct results. A deleted card should be removed from the UI and its corresponding folder deleted from the server.

### **Phase 2.5: CCEditor Refinements & Spec-Compliance**
**Goal:** To significantly enhance the `CardDetails` page by incorporating the most valuable fields and UI patterns from CCEditor, ensuring our application is compliant with the V2/V3 Character Card specifications. This phase bridges the gap between our current functionality and a truly feature-complete editing experience.

**Key Features:**

*   **V2/V3 Data Model Compliance:**
    *   **Backend & Frontend:** Update the core `Card` data structure on both the server and the client to be fully compliant with the V2/V3 specs. This includes:
        *   Adding new fields: `nickname`, `character_version`, `mes_example`, `system_prompt`, `post_history_instructions`, `alternate_greetings`, `group_only_greetings`, and the `extensions` object.
        *   Aligning date fields with the spec (`creation_date`, `modification_date` as Unix timestamps).
    *   **Backend:** Enhance the `POST /api/cards/upload` endpoint to correctly parse V2/V3-compliant cards and map their nested `data` structure to our flat server model.

*   **Enhanced "Basic Info" Tab:**
    *   **Frontend:** Add new, editable fields to the "Basic Info" tab for `Nickname` and `Character Version`.

*   **Enhanced "Details" Tab:**
    *   **Frontend:** Add new, editable text areas for `Message Example`, `System Prompt`, and `Post History Instructions`.
    *   **Frontend:** Implement a `TextArrayEditor` component (inspired by CCEditor's) to provide a dynamic list editor for `Alternate Greetings` and `Group Only Greetings`, allowing users to add, delete, and reorder items.

*   **New "Advanced" Tab:**
    *   **Frontend:** Create a new, read-only "Advanced" tab on the `CardDetails` page.
    *   **Frontend:** This tab will feature a JSON editor/viewer to display the raw contents of the `extensions` field, providing transparency for power users.

**Confirmation Before Proceeding:**
*   **Manual Test:** Upload a V2 or V3 spec-compliant character card (`.png` or `.json`).
*   **Verification:**
    *   Confirm that all new fields (e.g., `nickname`, `alternate_greetings`) are correctly parsed and displayed in the appropriate tabs on the `CardDetails` page.
    *   Edit and save all new fields. The changes must persist correctly.
    *   Use the `TextArrayEditor` to add, remove, and reorder an alternate greeting and confirm the changes are saved.
    *   View the `extensions` data in the new "Advanced" tab.

Phase 3: Advanced Management – Power & Efficiency
Goal: To introduce more powerful, "power-user" features for managing a large and complex collection efficiently, with a focus on versioning and archival.
Key Features:
•	**New: Archival & Versioning System:**
o	**Backend:** Implement the `Delete Card + Archive` logic, which moves the entire card folder to a separate `archive` directory.
o	**Backend:** Modify the card edit logic to automatically save a timestamped copy of the `card.json` file into a `versions` sub-folder before saving changes.
o	**Frontend:** Implement a **"Version History" Tab** on the `CardDetails` page to list, preview, and revert to past versions for both `card.json` and the card's image.
o	**New Feature: Image Versioning:** The backend will archive the old `avatar.png` when a new one is uploaded, linking it to the version history.
•	**New: Advanced Card Details & Tools:**
o	**Frontend:** Implement the remaining CCEditor tabs: "Character Book", "Advanced" (for viewing raw JSON), and a "Tool" tab for template management.
o	**New Feature:** Add UI for uploading and viewing associated files: `Card HTML File`, `Creator Notes HTML`, and `Favorite Chats`.
•	**New Feature: Advanced Organization:**
o	Implement a dedicated **Tag Management Page** to edit, merge, and delete tags.
o	Implement UI for creating and managing custom `Series/Collections`.
o	Implement dynamic, view-based grouping for `Platform Source`, `Creator`, and `Topic`.
o	**New Feature:** Enhance tags with `Color-coding` and `Emojis`.
•	**New: Enhanced Deletion Logic:**
o	Implement more intelligent deletion confirmation dialogs that warn the user if a card has a version history, and require extra confirmation for the "Delete + Archive" action.
•	Advanced Filtering: Add filters for attributes like "has lorebook," "has gallery," star rating, etc.
o	**New Feature:** Add a filter to `Hide Cards` from view.
o	**New Feature:** Implement `Saved Searches/Filters`.
•	Bulk Actions: Implement the ability to select multiple cards and perform actions like "add tag to selected" or "delete selected."
•	**New: Bulk Data Management:**
o	Implement the **Download Date Tracking** feature, allowing users to bulk-update cards with a download date from a text file.
•	Favorites & Flagging System:
o	Add the ability to mark cards as "favorites" for quick access.
o	**New Feature:** Add separate systems to mark cards as `'Recommended'` and `'Chat Later'`.
•	**New Feature: UX Enhancements:**
o	Add a `Randomize Catalogue` button to the gallery.
Confirmation Before Proceeding:
•	Manual Test: Edit a card multiple times. Use the "Version History" tab to revert to a previous version. Use the "Delete + Archive" function.
•	Verification: Successfully reverting a card should create a new version of the current state and restore the old one. An archived card's folder should be moved to the correct directory.

Phase 4: Personalization, Data Integrity & Deployment
Goal: To finalize the application by adding personalization features, ensuring data longevity, and preparing it for easy local deployment.
Key Features:
•	Data Integrity:
o	Implement a simple, one-click "Backup" and "Restore" feature (now simplified by the folder-per-card structure).
•	**New: UI & UX Polish:**
o	Implement **Char & Token Count** on relevant text fields.
o	Implement the ability to upload and manage **Card Galleries** and **Backgrounds**, storing them within each card's dedicated folder.
•	Personalization:
o	Add a "Custom User Notes" section to each card, including a specific feature for `Track Progress`.
	o	**New:** This is a good place to add other personalization features like **Star Ratings**.
	o	**New Feature:** Add fields for `Recommended Prompts` and `Recommended Settings`.
	o	**New Feature:** Add a `Comment System` for user-written comments on a card.
	o	**New Feature:** Implement a `Recently Visited History` list.
	o	**New Feature:** Allow associating `User Personas` with cards.
	o	**New Feature:** Allow applying a `Custom Theme/Background` to a card's view.
•	**New Feature: Advanced Data Management:**
	o	Add a filter for cards that have `User Notes`.
•	Security & Access:
o	Implement a simple password protection system for the application.
	o	Ensure the application can be easily run locally and provide documentation for accessing it across a local network.
Confirmation Before Proceeding:
•	Manual Test: Create a full backup. Delete a card, then use the restore function.
•	Verification: The deleted card should reappear, confirming the backup/restore cycle works. Character and token counts should update live as the user types. The password system should successfully lock access.
