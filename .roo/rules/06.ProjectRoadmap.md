# 6. Project Roadmap
This roadmap outlines the development in four distinct phases, prioritizing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) first and then incrementally adding layers of functionality.
Phase 1: Foundation & MVP – The Core Archive
Goal: To establish the project's technical foundation and deliver the essential functionality for importing and viewing cards. This phase focuses on getting a usable, albeit simple, version of the application running.
Key Features:
•	Project Setup: Create the new monorepo structure with separate client (React) and server (Express) packages.
•	Backend API (V1): Develop the initial server with basic API endpoints to:
o	Read all cards for the main gallery view.
o	Handle single card uploads (from .png files).
o	Serve individual card data.
•	Frontend UI:
o	Migrate and adapt the core card parsing logic from CCEditor.
o	Build the main gallery page to display all imported cards.
o	Create a simple, read-only "Card Details" page.
•	**New: Data Storage (Revised Architecture):** Implement a **folder-per-card** storage system. Each card upload will create a dedicated directory containing its `card.json` data and `avatar.png` image. This is a foundational change to support future versioning and gallery features.
Confirmation Before Proceeding:
•	Manual Test: Successfully upload a character card.
•	Verification: Confirm the card's data is parsed correctly and a new folder is created for it on the server, containing the correct JSON data and image file. The card's image should be visible in the gallery.

Phase 2: Core Features – Organization & Interaction
Goal: To build upon the MVP by adding the fundamental tools for organizing and managing the card collection, with a focus on creating a complete CCEditor-style editing experience.
Key Features:
•	**New: Card Management (Major Enhancement):**
o	**Frontend:** Overhaul the `CardDetails` page to match the CCEditor two-column layout, including all core fields from the "Basic Info" and "Details" tabs. This includes implementing fields for Name, Nickname, Creator, Description, Personality, Scenario, First Message, Alternate Greetings, and more.
o	**Frontend:** The left column will display the card's avatar, initial filename, image dimensions, and detected Spec Version, along with action buttons for `Edit`, `Download PNG`, and `Download JSON`.
o	**Backend:** Expand the `PUT /api/cards/:id` endpoint to handle updates for all the newly implemented fields.
o	Implement the "Delete Card" functionality (direct delete with enhanced confirmation).
•	Basic Organization:
o	Develop the tagging system: create new tags and assign/remove them from cards.
•	Search & Filter (V1):
o	Implement a basic text search across card names and descriptions.
o	Implement filtering by one or more tags.
•	**New: Date Tracking:**
o	The backend will automatically add `importDate` and `lastModified` timestamps to the card's JSON data. These will be displayed in the UI.
•	UX: Add a basic light/dark mode toggle.
Confirmation Before Proceeding:
•	Manual Test: Edit a card using the new CCEditor-style interface and verify all changes persist.
•	Verification: Create several tags, apply them to multiple cards, and confirm the tag-based filter returns the correct results. A deleted card should be removed from the UI and its corresponding folder deleted from the server.

Phase 3: Advanced Management – Power & Efficiency
Goal: To introduce more powerful, "power-user" features for managing a large and complex collection efficiently, with a focus on versioning and archival.
Key Features:
•	**New: Archival & Versioning System:**
o	**Backend:** Implement the `Delete Card + Archive` logic, which moves the entire card folder to a separate `archive` directory.
o	**Backend:** Modify the card edit logic to automatically save a timestamped copy of the `card.json` file into a `versions` sub-folder before saving changes.
o	**Frontend:** Implement a **"Version History" Tab** on the `CardDetails` page to list, preview, and revert to past versions.
•	**New: Advanced Card Details & Tools:**
o	**Frontend:** Implement the remaining CCEditor tabs: "Character Book", "Advanced" (for viewing raw JSON), and a "Tool" tab for template management.
•	**New: Enhanced Deletion Logic:**
o	Implement more intelligent deletion confirmation dialogs that warn the user if a card has a version history, and require extra confirmation for the "Delete + Archive" action.
•	Advanced Filtering: Add filters for attributes like "has lorebook," "has gallery," star rating, etc.
•	Bulk Actions: Implement the ability to select multiple cards and perform actions like "add tag to selected" or "delete selected."
•	Favorites System: Add the ability to mark cards as "favorites" for quick access.
Confirmation Before Proceeding:
•	Manual Test: Edit a card multiple times. Use the "Version History" tab to revert to a previous version. Use the "Delete + Archive" function.
•	Verification: Successfully reverting a card should create a new version of the current state and restore the old one. An archived card's folder should be moved to the correct directory.

Phase 4: Personalization, Data Integrity & Deployment
Goal: To finalize the application by adding personalization features, ensuring data longevity, and preparing it for easy local deployment.
Key Features:
•	Data Integrity:
o	Implement a simple, one-click "Backup" and "Restore" feature (now simplified by the folder-per-card structure).
•	**New: UI & UX Polish:**
o	Implement **Char & Token Count** on relevant text fields.
o	Implement the ability to upload and manage **Card Galleries** and **Backgrounds**, storing them within each card's dedicated folder.
•	Personalization:
o	Add a "Custom User Notes" section to each card.
	o	**New:** This is a good place to add other personalization features like **Star Ratings**.
•	Security & Access:
o	Implement a simple password protection system for the application.
o	Ensure the application can be easily run locally and provide documentation for accessing it across a local network.
Confirmation Before Proceeding:
•	Manual Test: Create a full backup. Delete a card, then use the restore function.
•	Verification: The deleted card should reappear, confirming the backup/restore cycle works. Character and token counts should update live as the user types. The password system should successfully lock access.
