# 2. Project Objectives
The primary goal of "Cards Repo" is to create a specialized, single-user application that transforms a large, disorganized collection of AI character cards into a structured, searchable, and highly personal archive. The development will prioritize simplicity and maintainability, acknowledging the developer's beginner status and leveraging AI assistance for best practices.
The project's success will be measured against the following key objectives, grouped by focus area:
Core Functional Objectives
•	Centralized & Universal Archival: To create a single source of truth for all character cards, regardless of their original platform (Chub.ai, Janitor AI, SillyTavern, original creations). The system must reliably import and store all associated data, including core character definitions, creator notes (preserving HTML), and supplementary files like image galleries and backgrounds.
•	Efficient & Granular Management: To provide powerful tools for organizing a large collection. This goes beyond simple folders and includes multi-faceted systems like custom tags, series/collection grouping, creator-based grouping, and merging duplicates to maintain a clean and curated library.
•	Advanced Search & Discovery: To enable the user to find any card quickly and intuitively. The system will feature a robust, typo-tolerant search across all card data, combined with multi-layered filtering based on tags, attributes (e.g., "has lorebook," "has gallery"), ratings, and dates.
User Experience (UX) & Interface (UI) Objectives
•	Intuitive and Aesthetically Pleasing Interface: To design a modern, clean, and visually appealing UI that takes inspiration from leading platforms but is tailored for a personal archival experience. The interface will be "eye-catchy" but prioritize clarity and ease of use, featuring both light and dark modes.
•	Responsive and Uncluttered User Experience: The application must feel fast and responsive, even with thousands of cards. User actions (saving, deleting, tagging) will provide clear and immediate system feedback (e.g., success notifications, loading indicators). The design will use elements like pop-up previews ("Quick View") to provide information without forcing page reloads, ensuring a smooth workflow.
•	High Degree of Personalization: To make the repository feel uniquely personal. The user will be able to customize the experience through features like a favorites system, star ratings, custom notes, color-coded tags, and even reordering the layout of the card details page to suit their own preferences and workflow.
Technical & Developmental Objectives
•	Maintainable and Beginner-Friendly Codebase: The project will be developed with an emphasis on clean, well-commented, and understandable code. This is crucial for a beginner, ensuring the project can be maintained and expanded in the future. AI-driven assistance will be used to enforce best practices and explain complex concepts.
•	Secure and Accessible Local Deployment: The application will be designed as a self-hosted web server that runs locally. A primary objective is to ensure it can be securely accessed from other devices on the local network and, optionally, over the internet via secure tunneling solutions (like Cloudflared or Tailscale), without complex server configuration.
•	Phased and Realistic Development (MVP First): Given the extensive feature list, development will follow a phased approach. The initial goal is to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that covers the absolute essentials: importing cards, viewing them, basic tagging, and searching. More advanced features (merging, version control, bulk actions) will be added incrementally in subsequent phases. This approach ensures a functional product early on and prevents development from becoming overwhelming.
Data Integrity & Archival Objectives
•	Robust Data Integrity: All card data, user notes, and metadata must be saved reliably. The system will use a simple and stable data storage method (e.g., individual JSON files per card or a lightweight SQLite database) to prevent data corruption and ensure longevity.
•	Painless Backup & Recovery: To fulfill its archival purpose, the system must include a simple, one-click function to create a complete backup of the entire card library and an equally simple function to restore from that backup.
•	Comprehensive Version Control: To create a true archive, the system will not discard old data. Edits to cards and updates to images will create new versions while archiving the old ones. This provides a complete history for each card and allows the user to roll back to previous versions if needed, ensuring no data is ever truly lost.
