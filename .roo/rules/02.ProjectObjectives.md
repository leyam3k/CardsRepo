# 2. Project Objectives

## Mission Statement
To build "Cards Repo," a specialized, single-user application that transforms a large, disorganized collection of AI character cards into a structured, searchable, and highly personal archive. Development will prioritize simplicity, maintainability, and beginner-friendly practices, with AI assistance guiding best practices.

## Key Result Areas
The project's success will be measured by achieving the following objectives, grouped by focus area.

### Core Functionality
*   **Universal Archival:** Create a central repository for all character cards, regardless of origin (Chub.ai, Janitor AI, SillyTavern, etc.). The system will reliably import and store all card data, including creator notes (with HTML preserved), image galleries, and other supplementary files.
*   **Granular Management:** Provide powerful tools for organizing a large collection. This includes robust support for custom tags, series/collection grouping, creator-based organization, and intelligent duplicate merging to maintain a clean library.
*   **Advanced Search & Discovery:** Enable fast, intuitive card retrieval. Implement a typo-tolerant (fuzzy) search across all card data, combined with multi-layered filtering by tags, attributes (e.g., "has lorebook," "has gallery"), user ratings, and dates.

### User Experience (UX) & Interface (UI)
*   **Modern & Intuitive Interface:** Design a clean, visually appealing UI inspired by leading platforms, tailored for a personal archival experience. The interface will prioritize clarity and usability over flashy visuals, and will feature both light and dark modes.
*   **High-Performance UX:** Ensure the application remains fast and responsive, even when managing thousands of cards. User actions (saving, deleting, tagging) will provide immediate and clear feedback (e.g., success notifications, loading indicators) to create a smooth, uninterrupted workflow.
*   **Deep Personalization:** Make the repository feel uniquely personal. Users will be able to customize their experience with features like a favorites system, star ratings, private notes, color-coded tags, and a customizable layout for the card details page.

### Technical Excellence
*   **Maintainable & Beginner-Friendly Code:** Develop with an emphasis on clean, well-commented, and easily understandable code. This is crucial for ensuring the project can be maintained and expanded by a developer who is still learning.
*   **Secure & Accessible Local Deployment:** Design a self-hosted web server that runs locally and can be securely accessed from other devices on the local network. Include support for secure tunneling solutions (e.g., Cloudflared, Tailscale) for optional, simple remote access.
*   **Phased & Realistic Development (MVP First):** Follow a phased development approach, starting with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that covers the essentials: importing, viewing, basic tagging, and searching. Add advanced features (merging, versioning, bulk actions) in later, well-defined phases to ensure steady progress and prevent overwhelm.

### Data Integrity & Archival
*   **Rock-Solid Data Integrity:** Ensure all card data, user notes, and metadata are saved reliably using a simple and stable file-based storage system. This approach minimizes the risk of data corruption and ensures long-term data safety.
*   **Effortless Backup & Recovery:** Implement a simple, one-click function to create a complete backup of the entire card library and an equally simple function to restore from that backup, fulfilling the project's core archival purpose.
*   **Comprehensive Version Control:** Create a true digital archive by never discarding old data. Edits to card details and images will create new versions while archiving the old ones. This provides a complete, browsable history for each card and allows users to roll back to any previous state.
